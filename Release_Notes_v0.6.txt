Insurgency Sandstorm RCON Tool v0.6 released - a lot of new features, re-design and DB-Management!



Hi Admins and Server owners,

I just released version 0.6 of my Insurgency Sandstorm RCON Tool again coming with a lot of new features that I list down below in the release notes! I implemented all your feature requests, wishes and a couple of things I found convenient, like importing your v0.5 server database. Of course I would love, if you test it and let me know, in case you find bugs or have additional feature or change requests! So, if you like, give it a shot. It only takes a couple of minutes to try it out - please watch the known errors below.

Report any bug here or send me an e-mail/steam message: https://github.com/olli-e/ISRT-Insurgency-Sandstorm-RCON-Query-Tool/issues

Release Notes:
Re-Designed to "tabbed" layout for easier usage
Customizable RCON buttons are available now
Database can be backed up, imported or combined (Yes, you can import your v0.5 database now!)
Imported the new maps: Frost, Stork_Castle_x, Temple and Toro from mod.io
Added Wiki reference
Added customizable RCON commands as Custom Command Manager - save, add, delete

Known bugs:
List Player command produces a weird output that has to be structured - working on it - solution found, but a lot more difficult than I thought
Program throws an error if using 127.0.0.1 as IP - SourceQuery bug - will change it in the next version - switching sourcequery code - use your LAN IP instead

If you like to support me or the future development of the tool, you may want to consider buying me a coffee, since I'm a total coffee geek: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/oedelmeier

Thanks for your help, contribution or just giving it a chance!
Yours,
Madman
