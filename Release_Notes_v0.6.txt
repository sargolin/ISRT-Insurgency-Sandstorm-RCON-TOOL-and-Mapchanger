Insurgency Sandstorm RCON Tool v0.5 released - a lot of new features!



Hi Admins and Server owners,

Version 0.5 of the Insurgency Sandstorm RCON Tool for Windows and Linux has been released with a lot of new features! I'm still looking for users that might test it and let me know, in case you find bugs or have feature requests - if you like, give it a shot, it only takes a couple of minutes to try it.
