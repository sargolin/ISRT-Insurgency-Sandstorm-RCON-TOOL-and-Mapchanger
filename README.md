# Work in Progress - v0.1.1 released - ISRT-Insurgency-Sandstorm-RCON-TOOL-and-Mapchanger
This is a python- and PyQt5-based RCON Tool for mapchanging and other basic RCON functionalities that help administering and controlling Insurgency Sandstorm Servers. The first version will be based on spezifanta's SourceWatch (https://github.com/spezifanta/SourceWatch) and ttk1's Py-Rcon (https://github.com/ttk1/py-rcon) - in the future this will be replaced by similar integrated python-based modules to get rid of third party modules I don't have any control over.

For the tracking of development and progress, as well as integrated feature requests, look here: https://trello.com/b/BHMJLISQ/isrt-insurgency-sandstorm-rcon-tool-ins

## 1. Introduction
The first stage will be the minimum viable product (MVP - see 2.) so you can see and try-out its basic functionality and have it working correctly, without any basic installation routine. I'll just pre-compile it for Windows 10 and zip it (+ the required modules) up. In the future I'll add more and more functionality described in the features list and also add a proper installation/deinstallation routine:
