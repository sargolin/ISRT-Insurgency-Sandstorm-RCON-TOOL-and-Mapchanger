# ISRT Insurgency Sandstorm RCON TOOL v0.6 released
This is a python (3.8.6) - and PyQt5/SQLite3-based RCON Tool for mapchanging and other basic RCON functionalities that help administering and controlling Insurgency Sandstorm Servers. The first version will be based on spezifanta's SourceWatch and ttk1's Py-Rcon - in the future this will be replaced by similar integrated python-based modules to get rid of third party modules I don't have any control over. The first stage will be the minimum viable product (MVP) so you can see and try-out its basic functionality and have it working correctly, without any basic installation routine. I'll just pre-compile it for Windows 10 and Python 3.x directly while it's in development. In the future I'll add more and more functionality described in the features list and also add a proper installation/deinstallation routine:
